# The Church Web Platform - Example

** A specific readme for the example is on the TODO - for now use the README at repo root ***

How to create your specific project:
1. Make a fork of this project
2. Clone your fork
3. Check out the `master` branch. Maintain your project in that branch (the sharable platform is maintained in the `core` branch.).
4. (If there are non-styling and non-project-specific changes you'd like to contribute back to the project, cherry pick those into core and make a pull request from core to the source repo.)
